/**
 * Payee side: find the payments sent to your Gloam address, and read their notes.
 *
 * When someone pays a Gloam address (gloamr1.…), their app seals the payment
 * (gloam2t.…) so only that address's key opens it. Where the network has a
 * payment-message board (GloamPayMemo), the sealed payment is posted there
 * next to the payment's commitment, and the payee finds it by scanning the
 * board: scanIncomingPayments. Where there is no board, the payer hands the
 * sealed code over directly, and openIncomingPayment checks it.
 *
 * Anyone who knows your Gloam address can post a message to it, so a payment
 * only counts when its code opens the commitment the message names, and that
 * note is in the vault and not yet spent, both read at one pinned block (the
 * same rule the Gloam app's inbox uses). A payment is not yours until you
 * secure it: the payer made its secret and could still spend it back. Move it
 * into a fresh note only you know with sweepReceivedNote before you credit
 * anything.
