/**
 * Agent Wormhole's check before a payment (optional, off by default).
 *
 * With GLOAM_WORMHOLE_KEY set, every 402 this server is about to pay goes to
 * Agent Wormhole's hosted check first (POST /api/v1/check), and the payment
 * goes ahead only when the answer is allow. The check scans the payment request
 * for hidden instructions and tells whether it changed since it was first seen.
 *
 * What is sent: the payment request the payee returned (the 402 price) as
 * {"content": ...}, with the key as a bearer token. Nothing else: never a note,
 * a balance, the wallet, a key or the payment this server would make.
 *
 * It fails closed. A refuse, an abstain, an answer this code does not know, an
 * allow with findings attached, an allow that scanned nothing, an HTTP error,
 * a body that is not JSON, or no answer within the timeout all mean: do not pay.
 *
 * The answer carries a signed attestation. Agent Wormhole documents how to
 * check the signatures on its /verify receipts and launch attestations, but not
 * yet the canonical form of a /check attestation, so it is kept in the result
 * (and the refusal) for an operator to check, not verified here.
