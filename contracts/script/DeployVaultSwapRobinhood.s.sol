 * Private swaps through the Robinhood Chain mainnet vault (GloamVaultSwapV4).
 * No owner, no admin, no upgrade: the vault, the treasury, the PoolManager and
 * the allowed pools are fixed here for good. A new list means a new router.
 *
 * The USER runs this. It is NOT executed by CI or by any agent.
 *
 *   export DEPLOYER_PK=0x...      # any funded mainnet account; it gets no powers
 *   export TREASURY=0x...         # where each swap's unused input goes (the treasury)
 *   forge script script/DeployVaultSwapRobinhood.s.sol:DeployVaultSwapRobinhood \
 *     --rpc-url https://rpc.mainnet.chain.robinhood.com --broadcast
 *
 * After: put the router address in VAULT_SWAP_ROUTERS[4663] (app/src/lib/vaultSwap.ts).
 * The pool list there (RH_SWAP_POOLS) must stay the same as the one below.
