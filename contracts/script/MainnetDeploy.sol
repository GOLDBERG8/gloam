/**
 * The mainnet deploy every chain shares, so Tempo and Robinhood Chain get the
 * same pool wired the same way: the Groth16 verifiers from the trusted setup's
 * final keys (src/verifiers/final) and their adapters, the
 * DualProofVerifier, ShieldPoolPayments (no sealed swap), the shield verifier
 * (deposits need shieldBound()), deposit limits on with each listed asset,
 * the cash-out fee, an optional handoff to a multisig owner, and endSetup() last.
 *
 * After endSetup the owner can lower a limit at once (lowerDepositLimit, down
 * to 0/0 to close deposits) but raising one or listing a new asset takes the
 * 3-day timelock. Withdrawals and private transfers are never limited.
 *
 * Cash-out fee: deposits and private transfers are free; unshield keeps
 * WITHDRAW_FEE_BPS of the amount in the pool for FEE_RECIPIENT, who is paid by
 * collectFees(asset) (anyone may call it). The contract caps it at 100 bps (1%).
 * After endSetup the fee can be lowered at once (lowerWithdrawFee) but raising
 * it or changing the recipient takes the 3-day timelock, so if FEE_RECIPIENT is
 * left unset the pool launches with the fee off.
 *
 * Key gate: before the pool exists, the freshly deployed verifiers must accept
 * real proofs made with the ceremony's final keys and reject proofs made with
 * the dev keys (script/KeyCheckProofs.sol). A verifier on dev keys can be fooled
 * by whoever made them, so the script stops there (pre-mainnet audit GATE 2).
 * After the broadcast every setting is checked again and any mismatch fails the
 * run (GATE 1, F3): if it fails, do not announce the pool, deploy a fresh one.
 *
 * Environment (read by every chain's script):
 *   DEPLOYER_PK          funded deployer
 *   POSEIDON2            PoseidonT3 deployed on this chain (circuits/scripts/deploy-poseidon.mjs)
 *   LIMIT_ASSETS         assets to list, comma separated (0x0 means the chain's native coin, where allowed)
 *   LIMIT_PER_DEPOSIT    per-deposit limit for each, raw units, same order
 *   LIMIT_TOTAL          total limit for each, raw units, same order
 *   WITHDRAW_FEE_BPS     cash-out fee in basis points, default 25 (0.25%), max 100 (1%)
 *   FEE_RECIPIENT        who collects cash-out fees; unset means the fee stays OFF
 *   NEW_OWNER            the owner multisig; it must call acceptOwnership() afterwards. It must
 *                        be a contract unless NEW_OWNER_EOA=1. Unset: the deployer keeps the pool.
