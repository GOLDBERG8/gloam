# Gloam circuits

**Proof system:** Groth16 on BN254. Circuits are written in Circom 2.1.6 (`pragma circom 2.1.6` in every file) with circomlib 2.0.5, and proved and verified with snarkjs 0.7.5, in the browser and in Node. Pool circuits are checked on-chain by snarkjs-exported Solidity verifiers; the proofs a holder shares with others are checked off-chain.

**Trusted setup: two key sets.** The testnet keys come from a 2^16 Powers of Tau file and a single-contributor phase-2 contribution with throwaway entropy: fine for testnet, never for real money, since whoever held that entropy could forge proofs. Mainnet uses the multi-party ceremony's final keys (13 contributors, beacon drand round 6561386, release `ceremony-final`; see [`../ceremony`](../ceremony)): `../src/verifiers/final` on chain and `app/public/circuits/final` in the app, hash-pinned. `scripts/gen-key-fixtures.mjs` makes real proofs with both sets (`../script/KeyCheckProofs.sol`), and the mainnet deploy refuses to create a pool unless its verifiers accept the final-key proofs and reject the dev ones (audit M-2, pre-mainnet GATE 2).

**Do not deploy a mock verifier that always returns true on a funded pool.**

## Circuits

| Circuit | Source | Constraints | Public inputs | Checked by | Status (mainnet and testnet) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| shield | `shield/shield.circom` | 390 | `commitment, amount, asset` | On-chain, `ShieldIVerifier` via `shieldBound()` | Live |
| transfer (1 in, 2 out) | `transfer/transfer.circom` | 6,270 | `root, nullifier, newCommitment0, newCommitment1` | On-chain, `DualProofVerifier` (4 inputs) | Live |
| unshield | `unshield/unshield.circom` | 5,491 | `root, nullifier, asset, amount, recipient` | On-chain, `DualProofVerifier` (5 inputs) | Live |
| sealedSwap | `sealedSwap/sealedSwap.circom` | 6,649 | `root, nullifier, newCommitmentOut, newCommitmentChange, assetIn, assetOut, amountOutMin, rateIn, rateOut` | On-chain verifier built, not wired (`sealedSwapVerifier = 0`) | **Disabled** |
| solvency (proof of funds) | `solvency/solvency.circom` | 22,244 | `root, asset, threshold, context, nullifier[0..3]` | Off-chain, gloam.trade/verify | Live |
| receipt (proof of payment) | `receipt/receipt.circom` | 5,510 | `root, commitment, asset, minAmount, reveal, shownAmount, context` | Off-chain, gloam.trade/verify | Live |
| payroll_total | `payroll_total/payroll_total.circom` | 37,278 | `asset, total, count, paymentsHash, context` | Off-chain, gloam.trade/verify | Live |

All Merkle membership uses `common/merkle_poseidon.circom` at depth 20. Browser artifacts live in `app/public/circuits/` (`shield`, `transfer`, `unshield`, `sealed_swap`, `funds` for solvency, `receipt`, `payroll_total`) with the testnet dev keys; the mainnet final keys for the six ceremony circuits are in `app/public/circuits/final/` (the `.wasm` files are shared).

**`context`** (solvency, receipt, payroll_total) is `keccak256(abi.encode("gloam.proof.v1", kind, chainId, pool, expiresAt, verifier)) mod p`. It binds the label naming who the proof is for and its expiry into the proof, so a `gloamfunds1`, `gloampay1` or `gloamroll1` proof forwarded to someone else still shows who it was made for. The older `gloamdisc1` balance disclosure reuses the shield circuit and has no `context`, so it carries no recipient or expiry.

## Note scheme (Poseidon)

Must match `src/lib/NoteLibPoseidon.sol` and `app/src/lib/notePoseidon.ts`.

```
secret        ← random field element (wallet / browser only)
amount        ← uint256
asset         ← address (0 = native)

commitment = Poseidon(secret, amount, asset)
nullifier  = Poseidon(secret, commitment)
root       = PoseidonMerkle(commitment, path…)   // depth 20
```

## Pool circuits

### Shield (deposit)

Proves the inserted leaf opens to the public `(amount, asset)` under some secret, so a deposit cannot embed more value than it sends (audit C1). **Private:** `secret`.

### Unshield

**Private:** `secret`, Merkle path to `commitment`.  
**Public (order fixed, `PROOF_LAYOUT_VERSION = 2`):**

| Index | Name | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | `root` | Must be a known pool root |
| 1 | `nullifier` | Marks note spent |
| 2 | `asset` | `uint160` cast |
| 3 | `amount` | Exact exit amount |
| 4 | `recipient` | `uint160`, bound so a relayer cannot redirect the payout |

**Constraints:** `commitment = H(secret, amount, asset)`; Merkle path proves `commitment` is in the tree at `root`; `nullifier = H(secret, commitment)`; range checks.

### Transfer

Spend one note into two new commitments (payment + change), same asset.

| Index | Name |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | `root` |
| 1 | `nullifier` |
| 2 | `newCommitment0` (payment) |
| 3 | `newCommitment1` (change) |

**Private:** secret, amount/asset of spent note, split amounts, new secrets, Merkle path.  
Value conservation: `amount_in = amount_out0 + amount_out1`.

### Sealed swap (disabled)

Built and compiled, but private trade is switched off pending audit of its solvency accounting. See [`../SEALED_TRADE.md`](../SEALED_TRADE.md).

## Verifiers (`src/verifiers/`)

| Contract | Role | On a live pool? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ShieldVerifier` + `ShieldIVerifier` | Groth16 shield proof | Yes, as `shieldVerifier` |
| `UnshieldVerifier` + `UnshieldIVerifier` | Groth16 unshield proof | Yes, behind `DualProofVerifier` |
| `TransferVerifier` + `TransferIVerifier` | Groth16 transfer proof | Yes, behind `DualProofVerifier` |
| `DualProofVerifier` | Routes 5 inputs to unshield, 4 to transfer | Yes, as `verifier` |
| `SealedSwapVerifier` + `SealedSwapIVerifier` | Groth16 sealed swap proof | **No** (`sealedSwapVerifier = 0`) |
| `ScaffoldUnshieldVerifier` / `ScaffoldIVerifier` | Old placeholder | **Never** on a funded pool |
| `RejectVerifier` | Always false (locks a path) | Tests / emergency lock only |

The table is the testnet set. The mainnet pools use the same contracts built from the final keys (`src/verifiers/final`, `*Final`), behind the same `DualProofVerifier`, and have no sealed swap verifier at all.

Live addresses: [`../ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md). Mainnet pools (`ShieldPoolPayments`, final keys): Robinhood Chain `4663` `0xMAINNET_RH_POOL`, Tempo `4217` `0xMAINNET_TEMPO_POOL`. Testnet pools (dev keys): Robinhood Chain `46630` `0x72406D9597807A46f730d8b4fDBC5aC45Dc1d740`, Tempo `42431` `0x841DC046Ea3CC842BA3A855731472c6Eb0F2d5eb`. Earlier pools (including the Phase-1 keccak pool `0x2BD9…`) are superseded.

## App helpers

| Module | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `app/src/lib/notePoseidon.ts` | Note commitments and nullifiers |
| `app/src/lib/merklePoseidon.ts` | Poseidon tree = Solidity |
| `app/src/lib/treeSync.ts` | Rebuild leaves from pool events |
| `app/src/lib/proverPoseidon.ts`, `proverTransfer.ts` | Witness builders |
| `app/src/lib/proveClient.ts` | Browser snarkjs |
| `app/src/lib/proofs/` | Proof of funds, payment and payroll total (prove + verify) |

## Tools

```bash
# one-time
cargo install --git https://github.com/iden3/circom.git --tag v2.1.9 circom   # any compiler >= 2.1.6
cd contracts/circuits
npm i
npm run check-tools

# compile one pool circuit
mkdir -p build/unshield
circom unshield/unshield.circom --r1cs --wasm --sym -o build/unshield -l node_modules

# proof-of-funds / payment / payroll circuits: compile, dev setup, copy artifacts to the app
node scripts/build-proof-circuits.mjs
node scripts/test-proof-circuits.mjs
```

### Deploy the pool stack (testnet)

```bash
cd contracts && forge build
cd circuits
npm i   # circomlibjs ethers snarkjs
export DEPLOYER_PK=0x...
export RPC_URL=https://rpc.testnet.chain.robinhood.com
node scripts/deploy-phase2.mjs
# → writes deployments/poseidon-testnet.json
```

Then in Vercel / app env:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSEIDON_SHIELD_POOL=0x...   # ShieldPoolPoseidon
NEXT_PUBLIC_HASH_SCHEME=poseidon
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHIELD_DEPLOY_BLOCK=<deploy block>
```

## Safety

- Two key sets: the dev-ceremony keys are for the testnets only (never present them as production or use them for real money); mainnet uses the ceremony's final keys.
- Unit tests may use `MockVerifier`; production never does.
- Every regeneration of a proving key invalidates proofs made with the previous key; for the pool circuits the on-chain verifier must also be redeployed and switched through the 3-day timelock.
