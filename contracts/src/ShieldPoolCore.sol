/**
 * @title ShieldPoolCore
 * @notice The payment vault every Gloam pool shares: Poseidon Merkle tree,
 *         deposits (shield / shieldBound), private transfers, withdrawals
 *         (unshield), the setup-then-timelock owner, and beta deposit limits.
 * @dev Leaves/roots stored as uint256 field elements, exposed as bytes32 for IShieldPool.
 *      ShieldPoolPoseidon adds sealed swaps on top; ShieldPoolPayments is this alone.
 *
 * Owner powers (no-middlemen hardening):
 *  - The owner has NO function that moves user funds. There is no emergencyWithdraw;
 *    notes leave the pool only through proof-gated unshield(). sweepStrayNative()
 *    can only take native currency above deposited[address(0)] + feesOwed[address(0)],
 *    i.e. ETH sent straight to receive() that backs no note and is no owed fee.
 *  - Every setter that affects proof validity or asset flows is instant only
 *    during setup mode. After endSetup() it must go through ChangeTimelock:
 *    queueChange -> CHANGE_DELAY (3 days) public notice -> executeChange.
 *  - Deposit limits (mainnet beta): once turnOnDepositLimits() runs in setup, an
 *    asset can be deposited only up to its perDeposit and total limits, and an
 *    asset with no limit cannot be deposited at all. The owner can LOWER a limit
 *    instantly (down to zero, which closes deposits for that asset); raising one
 *    goes through the timelock. Limits never touch transfers or withdrawals.
 *  - Cash-out fee (mainnet): deposits and private transfers are free; unshield()
 *    keeps withdrawFeeBps of the proven amount (rounded down, capped at
 *    MAX_WITHDRAW_FEE_BPS = 1%) in the pool as feesOwed[asset]. Anyone can call
 *    collectFees(asset) to send it to feeRecipient; unshield never calls the
 *    recipient, so a frozen or reverting recipient cannot block a withdrawal.
 *    Off (0 bps, no recipient) by default. Set instantly in setup, then only
 *    through the timelock; lowering or turning it off is instant.
 *    Invariant: balance(asset) >= deposited[asset] + feesOwed[asset].
