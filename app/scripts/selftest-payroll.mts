/**
 * Self-test: the payroll engine (lib/payroll) never writes off a payment that
 * could still land, and only calls a row paid when the pool holds that row's
 * own payment.
 *
 * Runs the app's own engine, note store and run store against an in-memory
 * pool that follows ShieldPool.transfer's rules (known root, nullifier spent
 * once, both outputs inserted, a duplicate commitment refused); proofs are not
 * checked here. Covers: a receipt that timed out and lands later, a retry past
 * the wait window (the same payment again, so only one copy can land), the
 * original landing while the retry is out, a good receipt for some other
 * transaction, the note spent by another payment (the only case its codes
 * go), a wallet prompt turned down, a relay that sent it but lost its reply,
 * the change counted only once its payment lands, and the backup side: unsettled runs are never pruned and come back from a
 * backup, and Sent links carry every unused code.
 * Review finding 4, 23 Oct 2026: two old copies of one run (two tabs, a page
 * left open) pay each person once; a run going in another tab is refused,
 * with and without Web Locks; a note spent elsewhere is never paid with; and
 * two tabs saving runs at once keep both.
 *
 * Run from app/:  ../mcp/node_modules/.bin/tsx scripts/selftest-payroll.mts
