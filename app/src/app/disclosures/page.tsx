      <h2>Risk of loss</h2>
      <p>
        Digital assets, including cryptocurrencies and tokenized real-world
        assets such as stock tokens, can lose value rapidly and in full. Past
        performance is not indicative of future results. You may lose some or
        all of the assets you use with the protocol or related smart contracts.
      </p>
      <h2>Smart contract & protocol risk</h2>
      <p>
        Smart contracts may contain bugs, economic design flaws, or be exploited.
        Upgrades, admin keys, oracles, bridges, and sequencers introduce
        additional risk. Audits, if any, do not eliminate risk.
      </p>
      <h2>Mainnet is beta</h2>
      <p>
        From Gloam&apos;s mainnet launch on 21 October 2026, the mainnet pools
        on Robinhood Chain and Tempo hold real money. They are beta software.
        The contracts were reviewed internally before launch; an external
        audit is planned and has not been done.
      </p>
      <p>
        Deposits are capped during the beta: 500 per deposit and 25,000 in
        total for each stablecoin, and 25,000 per deposit and 250,000 in total
        for $GLOAM. Cash outs and private payments are never limited.
        Deposits and private payments are free; a cash out costs 0.25% of its
        amount.
      </p>
      <p>
        At launch the owner and treasury is a single wallet (a multisig is
        planned), and the Gloam team runs the relay. The relay only submits
        transactions that are already proven and pays their network fee; it
        cannot move or redirect money. No function lets the team take pooled
        funds. Raising limits, adding assets or changing verifiers waits a
        public three-day timelock; the owner can lower limits or close
        deposits at once.
      </p>
      <p>
        The testnets (Robinhood Chain testnet and Tempo Moderato) use test
        tokens with no value and single-party development keys.
        Mainnet uses the final keys from the 13-contributor trusted setup.
      </p>
      <h2>Privacy is not absolute</h2>
      <p>
        Shielded balances and private transactions reduce public visibility;
        they do not make activity invisible to all parties in all conditions.
        Timing analysis, amount correlation at the edge of a privacy set, user
        error, malware, and legal process may still expose information.
      </p>
      <h2>Regulatory uncertainty</h2>
      <p>
        Tokenized equities and privacy technologies sit in evolving regulatory
        environments. Availability of assets and features may depend on
        jurisdiction. You are responsible for determining whether use is lawful
        for you.
      </p>
      <h2>No custody</h2>
      <p>
        Gloam interfaces do not custody user funds. You interact with networks
        and contracts through your own wallet. Support cannot recover lost keys
        or reverse confirmed transactions.
      </p>
      <h2>Third-party & chain risk</h2>
      <p>
        Robinhood Chain, Tempo, Ethereum, bridges, RPCs, and other infrastructure may
        halt, reorg, censor, or fail. We do not control those systems.
      </p>
      <h2>Interface only</h2>
      <p>
        Website and app UIs may be one of several ways to interact with
        underlying contracts. The interface can go offline while contracts
        remain reachable by other means.
      </p>
      <h2>Forward-looking statements</h2>
      <p>
        Roadmaps, “coming soon” features, and testnet plans are aspirational.
        Nothing obligates us to ship any feature on any timeline.
