      <h2 id="replaced">What replaced it</h2>
      <p>
        <Link href="/docs/private-swaps">Private swaps</Link>{" "}
        are live on
        Robinhood Chain and Tempo mainnet, under Vault &gt; Swap. One
        transaction takes a note out of the vault, swaps it on a public DEX
        for an exact amount, and puts the output back as a new private note.
      </p>
      <p>
        The trade-off is different. A private swap keeps who swapped private,
        and the tokens and amounts are public, like any DEX trade. The sealed
        swap tried to keep the size private too, and could not stay solvent
        doing it.
      </p>

      <h2 id="why-retired">Why it was retired</h2>
      <p>
        A sealed swap spends an <code>assetIn</code> note and mints an{" "}
        <code>assetOut</code> note with both amounts private, but no tokens
        move, so the pool ends up owing <code>assetOut</code> it does not
        physically hold (audit H1). Rather than ship an insolvent swap or
        reveal your size to fix the accounting, the on-chain verifier on the
        testnet pools is set to zero and the swap stays off.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>On mainnet there is nothing to switch on.</strong> The mainnet
        vaults (<code>ShieldPoolPayments</code>) have no sealed swap code at
        all. Private swaps do not change that: their routers are separate
        contracts that use only the vault&apos;s normal calls.
      </p>

      <h2 id="stock-tokens">Stock tokens today</h2>
      <p>
        On Robinhood Chain testnet you can{" "}
        <AppLink href="/app/vault?tab=shield">shield</AppLink> stock tokens (TSLA, AMZN, PLTR,
        NFLX and AMD on testnet), hold them privately, and{" "}
        <AppLink href="/app/vault?tab=move">send them privately</AppLink>. Stock tokens
        are not on mainnet, and private swaps do not cover them.

        steps={[
          {
            n: "1",
            title: "Pick direction + vault note",
            body: "Buy (ETH → stock) or sell (stock → ETH). Spend a note you already hold in the vault.",
          },
          {
            n: "2",
            title: "Prove the trade",
            body: "Browser builds a sealed-swap proof. Size stays private; the chain only sees a vault proof.",

          },
        ]}
      />
      <p>
        Rates came from <strong>coarsened display marks</strong> (Yahoo and
        CoinGecko), not an on-chain oracle, and it ran on dev ceremony keys
        only. The public <code>amountOutMin</code> was a 1-wei floor, so the
        size did not show, while the rates and the asset pair did.

        This path stays on the Robinhood Chain testnet Trade tab. Your wallet
        shows on both public edges. On mainnet, use{" "}
        <Link href="/docs/private-swaps">private swaps</Link> instead: the
        relay sends them and your wallet never shows.
