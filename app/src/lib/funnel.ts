/**
 * Claim-link counts: four daily totals that show whether the invite loop works.
 *
 *   link_created   someone made a claim link and the payment landed
 *   link_opened    a claim link was opened in Gloam
 *   link_claimed   a claim link was claimed into a balance
 *   claimer_sent   someone who claimed a link made their own first payment
 *
 * Each event is only "add 1 to today's total": no cookie, no id, no amount, no
 * address, no code. They run without the cookie banner because nothing in them
 * can say who did what (the privacy and cookie pages say so). Whether this
 * browser already counted something is kept in local storage only, so the
 * server never learns it.
